I’m pleased to welcome you to my first blog post on Web Accessibility. If you’ve never heard of it, I hope that this website will serve as a resource to keep you up-to-date on what it is and why it’s needed.

**What is Accessibility?**

Accessibility is defined as the availability to every individual regardless of disability, situation or other factors.

**Who/what all is involved in Accessibility?**

* Congress: Title III (1973)
* Department of Justice Response (2010)
* Trial Lawyers
* World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

**What type of business is Most at Risk?**

* Banking/Finance
* Retails, E-Commerce
* Travel, Hospitality, Food Service
* Health Care
* Multiple Sites, Multiple Brands

**What took so long for Accessibility to become a big topic?**

* Recently became a prominent issue
* Trade off between Design and Accessibility
* Limited by budget/calendar

**What impairments must we consider in making a Website Accessible?**

**Visual**(Applies to ~7,675,600 = 2.4% -[source](https://www.nfb.org/resources/blindness-statistics?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIisyNzcyI3AIVg7bACh11lQJNEAAYASAAEgIAc_D_BwE))

This impairment applies to people with low vision, color blindness, and blindness. They often have to rely on the following to use the web:

* Zooming in on the page or enlarging text size
* Using a screen reader that speaks content to them
* Using a Braille reader
* Using high contrast modes

**Auditory**(Applies to ~27,700,000 = 14% -[source](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing))

This impairment includes any type of hearing loss, hearing aid usage and deafness. People with this impairment often rely on the following to use the web effectively:

* Transcripts/captions for audio content
* Media players that display captions with adjustable fonts
* Options to stop, pause and adjust the volume of audio content
* Foreground audio clearly distinguishable from background noise

**Cognitive**(Applies to ~44,700,000 = 18.5% -[source](https://www.caregiver.org/incidence-and-prevalence-major-causes-brain-impairment))

Neurological, behavioral, and mental disorders. Often rely on the following to navigate web content:

* Clearly structured content
* Simple navigation and link titles
* Consistent labeling of forms and buttons
* Options to suppress blinking and flashing content
* Text-to-speech software
* Enlarging the webpage or text

**Physical**(Applies to ~39,500,000 = 16.1% -[source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm))

Range from arthritis and carpal tunnel, to paralysis and missing limbs. Often use special technology to interact with web content:

* Head pointer, mouth stick, or other typing aids
* On-screen keyboard with trackball, joystick, etc.
* Switches operated by foot, shoulder, etc.
* Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other hands-free options

**What are the guidelines to follow to stay Accessible?**

There is a set of guidelines called the[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) that are constantly being updated.

**Three Levels of Conformance?**

WCAG 2.0 guidelines are categorized into three levels of conformance in order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations:

* **Level A (lowest)** - *For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.*
* ***Level* AA (mid range)** - *For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.* Most organizations set their standards at level AA because it is both achievable and meaningful, without being too disruptive to the design and development process.
* ***Level* AAA (highest)** - *For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.*

**Video**

We believe that technology should be accessible to everyone — including Sady Paulson, who uses Switch Control on a Mac to share her thoughts on doing what you love.

Upon arriving home yesterday, from my fifth Smashing Conference, I was able to reflect back on not only another amazing conference but all of the great people I was able to meet and connect with. Many great stories were shared regarding their work and problems they were trying to solve. What I love about this conference is the community of people trying to better themselves and share their perspective on how they've solved certain problems which could possible help others in their own work. 

I﻿ attended two workshops, both of which will help me with my daily work. Stephanie Eckles workshop, Building Interactive, Accessible Components made me rethink certain components we have on our design system to improve them. Miriam Suzanne's workshop, Modern CSS Architecture simplified styling techniques which I've often overthought how to implement. 

O﻿n Monday night, I attended the Jam Session event at the Figma office, which Smashing Conference always holds the night before the first day of talks. This was an event that I've always toyed with the idea of speaking at but would usually end up chickening out of submitting a talk. On August 29, I submitted my talk topic to the Smashing Magazine team to be included with the list of other speakers. It was the same topic that I spoke about at the Digital Collegium conference on September 29, but around a third of the total time to present it since they were just lightning talks.

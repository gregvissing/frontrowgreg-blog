Upon arriving home yesterday, from my fifth Smashing Conference, I was able to reflect back on not only another amazing conference but all of the great people I was able to meet and connect with. Many great stories were shared regarding their work and problems they were trying to solve. What I love about this conference is the community of people trying to better themselves and share their perspective on how they've solved certain problems which could possible help others in their own work. 

Iï»¿ attended two workshops, both of which will help me with my daily work. Stephanie Eckles workshop, Building Interactive, Accessible Components made me rethink certain components we have on our design system to improve them. Miriam Suzanne's workshop, Modern CSS Architecture simplified styling techniques which I've often overthought how to implement.

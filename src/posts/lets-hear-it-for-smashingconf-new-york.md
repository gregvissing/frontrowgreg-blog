Upon arriving home yesterday, from my fifth Smashing Conference, I was able to reflect back on not only another amazing conference but all of the great people I was able to meet and connect with. Many great stories were shared regarding their work and problems they were trying to solve. What I love about this conference is the gathering of people trying to better themselves and share their perspective on how they've solved certain problems that could possible help others in their own work.

**Intro**

The idea of updating the project workflow in which I work with my co-workers as well as how I tackle projects has been looming over the past year. Up until this past week that has been put off for constant work on the new University of Cincinnati Foundation [website](https://foundation.uc.edu/) and [giving page](https://foundation.uc.edu/give). In this blog post, I want to highlight the most important key points for successfully getting through projects as smoothly as possible based on my experience as a Web Developer.

Workflow key points/steps

1. **Sell Project** - During this part, it's crucial for PMs and stakeholders to come to terms with the true nature of our work.
2. **Kick-off meeting** - This meeting is crucial to the success of the project, making sure everyone is on the same page and that deadlines are met.
3. * Everyone involved with project must attend kick-off meeting.
   * * Keeps everyone on the same page as far as ideas, timeline and critiques.
   * Discuss requirements of the project in order for group to get understanding of a realistic timeline/expectations.
   * * Existing project needing updated?
     * * Talk about current workflow and pain points.
       * What is positive about current project that can be kept?
     * New project?
     * * Why needed?
       * Discuss who it benefits.
       * Have we done any projects similar to this new one in past?
   * Based on requirements discussed, start a rough sketch out layout, identifying any functionality that will need to be considered for each section.
   * \
     with deadlines.
   *
4. Priorities Exercise
5. * Discuss emerging themes from interviews and introduce potential principles and tactics.
   * Discuss most important outcomes they care most about.
   * Goal of this exercise is to align around a set of shared outcomes and priorities.
6. Regroup/Next Steps
7. * Recap work that has been done since previous meeting. Talking about outcomes.
   * Cover any lingering questions, concerns and other words of wisdom that will help project be successful.
   * Explain what happened next with project and how they can stay involved with project.
8. Design Brief
9. * Define goals, principles and project scope of project.
   * Goals: spell out business and user needs.
   * Definition: what all needs to be included in project.
   * Principles: What are guiding principles of project?
   * Plan of attack: timeline and scope
   * Keep team informed during entire process.

As I sit back and reflect on the year that was 2020, I can't help but feel like I was on the longest and tallest roller coaster. It was full of ups, downs, and moments where my stomach felt like it was in a knot.

From a personal perspective, it's been stressful on my wife and I to get our kids through at-home learning. It's been a tag-team effort getting them to stay focused and complete everything. All in all, I'm proud of them for how they handled it in stride and still doing great in school. During this pandemic, I've gained a new appreciation for what teachers do and the work required to keep the kids focused and eager to learn new things.

On the professional side of my life, there were a couple of conference trips that I was looking forward to going to in 2020. [Smashing Conference](https://smashingconf.com) in Austin (June) and [An Event Apart](https://aneventapart.com/) in Orlando (October). I had been researching food options in Austin since the event was announced and the Orlando trip was going to be part of a two-week family vacation that included going to our favorite vacation spot, Walt Disney World. I did end up getting to attend some virtual Smashing Conferences, which were organized very well using the [Hopin](https://hopin.com/) platform.

I've added a lot of talented professionals to my network of resources to learn from. I'm grateful for each one of them that I've learned from but there a couple that deserve extra recognition based on how much they've helped me. Carl Schoof, for his animation courses, and Chris Kastner, for his knowledge/help with Blackbaud.

Have you ever thought about the workflows you utilize on a daily basis and knew you could do a better job of using your time more efficiently? Ever since launching the redesigned University of Cincinnati Foundation [website](https://foundation.uc.edu/) and [Donation](https://foundation.uc.edu/give) page in November, I've frequently thought about the best way to use my time in 2020 to maximize my project efficiency as well as paths for successfully completing my goals/objectives by the end of the fiscal year (June 30th, 2020). 2019 was quite the stressful year with the Campaign launch at the University of Cincinnati. It was very rewarding for the Communications team I'm a part of, but we all felt the strain, both mentally and physically. I look for 2020 to be the year I become a more well rounded asset to my employer. However, I did attend an amazing SmashingConf in [Toronto](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/), which I feel l was able to gain a lot of knowledge from and implement a lot of my learnings in the coming year.

The following is a list of my plans for 2020:

* **Conferences**: I will once again be attending SmashingConf, but this time in Austin, TX. I'm very excited about the speakers and workshops that have been announced so far. Sara Soueidan is one that I'm particularly interested in because she's an expert on accessibility. I'm not only excited to hear her talk but to attend her Front End Accessibility workshop as well! An Event Apart in Orlando is the other conference I'm attending. There are some incredible speakers on this lineup too. Dan Mall (Design Systems) and Val Head (Inclusive Animation) are the two speakers I'm most looking forward to at that conference. Just as I have for previous conferences, I'll come up with questions/ideas for how each speaker can help my work to get the most out of the conferences.
* **Goal: Develop guidelines for Accessibility/ADA Compliance**:
* **Goal: Update project request process**:
* **Goal: Work with Design Team to develop a Design System**:

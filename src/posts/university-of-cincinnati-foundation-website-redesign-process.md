This post will outline the process my team and I took to redesign the University of Cincinnati Foundation [website](https://foundation.uc.edu/). One of the reasons we initially decided this was the best route to go was due to the fact that it had a large amount of accessibility issues. At first my supervisor and I started tackling the accessibility error log but we soon realized we were going to be fighting an uphill battle of around 8000+ issue as well as delaying projects that we could've been working on.

The following are the steps that we took to complete the new website redesign process:

1. **RESEARCH**
2. **BRAND GUIDELINES**
3. **WIREFRAMES**
4. **DEVELOP**
5. **TEST**

Since the UC Foundation website is going to be a rather large redesign project, I figured I'd document everything that will be needed to make it successful. For this big project, I'm going to use a design systems process, which I learned in Brad Frost's workshop.

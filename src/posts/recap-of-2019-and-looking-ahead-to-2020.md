As another year comes to a close, I find myself again saying "where did the time go?" 2019 was a year that came with its fair share of struggles as well as rewards. The Communications team, that I'm a part of at the University of Cincinnati Foundation, was stretched to their limit, but we succeeded in delivering some amazing Campaign materials for the University of Cincinnati. My part in the Campaign work was to redesign the University of Cincinnati Foundation [website](https://foundation.uc.edu/) as well as the donation [page](https://foundation.uc.edu/give), which will soon reside on it's own sub-domain. These two projects accounted for two-fifths of my goals/objectives for the current fiscal year, which goes until the end of June. I will discuss the remaining three goals/objectives in the next section along with my plan for completing each.

## **...And in With 2020!**

Before I know it, 2020 will be here, filled with goals that I want to achieve both professionally and personally. The following are the remaining goals/objectives that I have left to complete for the fiscal year:

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->· <!--\[endif]-->Develop guidelines for Accessibility/ADA Compliance UCF website and work with colleagues in Advancement Services to develop Digital Policy that adheres to guidelines.

* * The new website isn't completely accessible, but as I develop these guidelines I will be able to update the necessary components with ease.
  * I've accumulated a number of useful resources to learning the best practices of Accessibility/ADA Compliance, that includes, conference videos, books, articles and a meet-up presentation I attended.
  * My goal by the end of this fiscal year is to incorporate accessibility into my workflow from the start of any project. I've been taking great pride in learning all that I can about these subjects.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->· <!--\[endif]-->Update project request process to better assess full scope of project needs and goals prior to project acceptance. Update project request process to better assess full scope of project needs and goals prior to project acceptance.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->o <!--\[endif]-->This goal is very much needed not only for myself but anyone else I work with on projects, to keep us all organized, accountable and on the same page throughout the project.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->o <!--\[endif]-->I'm considering incorporating a project management methodology after I've reviewed the possible options. Some of the popular methodologies include:

* * * Agile
    * Scrum
    * Kanban
    * Lean
    * Waterfall

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->o <!--\[endif]-->Considerations for the methodology that I eventually pick will hopefully be able to be used universally by anyone on my Communications team as well. The ideal methodology would have to meet the demands of cross-functional teams.

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->o <!--\[endif]-->What currently works?

<!--\[if !supportLists]-->o <!--\[endif]-->What needs fixed?

Other work goals/ideas:

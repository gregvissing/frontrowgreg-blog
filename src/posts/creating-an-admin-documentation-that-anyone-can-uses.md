An unfortunate reality of website projects is that it will need to be maintained, in the future, by the client without the developer's supervision. To avoid future website maintenance complaints or concerns I decided that the documentation would need to be catered to all audiences, include clear instructions for website updates and give the client a sense of ownership & confidence during the website hand-off meeting. To master this skill, the documentation author must be customer-service driven and able to explain technical details clearly enough for the administrator to understand.

Creating these manuals is a useful skill that I developed early in my development career for various SharePoint/InfoPath projects. By the time I started my first custom WordPress (WP) development position, my documentation skills became a beneficial asset to my project workflow. Before my first WP manual, I did my research before coming up with the contents regarding would be the most important details/content to include. To make sure that any admin with login credentials would be able to manage it, I decided that the audience I was writing to had never updated a WP website before. This strategy ensured that anyone, no matter their seniority at the company, would be able to seamlessly update the website. 

Looking back, I wish I had been creating the original document simultaneously with the development phase of that first website build. This change would've allowed me to more accurately walk the admin user through each updatable section in the manner in which I built it. Many times I would include helpful hints & tips for the user to ensure they updated the content the proper way in which it was developed for.

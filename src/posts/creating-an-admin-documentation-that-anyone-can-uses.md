An unfortunate reality of website projects is that it will need to be maintained, in the future, by the client without the developer's supervision. To avoid future website maintenance complaints or concerns I decided that the documentation would need to be catered to all audiences, include clear instructions for updating the website and give the client a sense of ownership & confidence during the website hand-off meeting.

Since this was for my first custom web development position, I wanted to really show off the documentation skills I had attained while creating them for various SharePoint projects I completed during my previous job.

A useful skill that I learned early on in my WordPress Development career was creating a documentation for the administrator(s) of a website I developed. Since this was for my first custom web development position, I wanted to really show off the documentation skills I had attained while creating them for various SharePoint projects I completed during my previous job. I did my research before coming up with the contents regarding would be the most important details/content to include. To make sure that any admin with login credentials would be able to manage it, I decided that the audience I was writing to had never updated a WordPress website before. This strategy ensured that anyone, no matter their seniority at the company, would be able to seamlessly update the website. 

Looking back, I wish I had been creating the original document simultaneously with the development phase of that first website build. This change would've allowed me to more accurately walk the admin user through each updatable section in the manner in which I built it. Many times I would include helpful hints & tips for the user to ensure they updated the content the proper way in which it was developed for.

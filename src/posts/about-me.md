My name is Greg Vissing from Cincinnati, OH. I work at The University of Cincinnati Foundation where I'm a Web Developer & UI Designer. I love that work that I do and the co-workers I can get to work with on a daily basis. I've been doing development work since 2008, where I did web applications support for TriHealth.

I'm very excited about this side project, **Let's ReVue**! I've [read](https://simpleprogrammer.com/blogging-software-developers/) that starting a blog about development is one of the best things I can do for my career. I've always followed and subscribed to websites to boost my development knowledge, which made me very thankful of them for explaining everything in a way that was understandable to me. [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) was one of the reasons I wanted to get into Web Development. I was fortunate enough to be able to go to their [Smashing Conference](https://smashingconf.com/) out in San Francisco last year. One thing I felt I had to do while out there was thank Vitaly Friedman for creating Smashing Magazine and telling him of the positive impact it had on my career and life.

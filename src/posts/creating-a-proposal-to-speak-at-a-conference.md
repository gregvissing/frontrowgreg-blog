Tï»¿his year is about me doing things out of my comfort zone. At the top of that list is public speaking. I've attended four Smashing Conferences now and have always wondered what it would be like to speak at one. Smashing Magazine, who puts on Smashing Conference, was one of the key factors in me wanting to become a Web Developer. They regularly have the most knowledgeable and friendly speakers present at their conferences each year. I know in order to be able to speak at that conference, I first need to build up my confidence, experience and delivery before attempting to submit a proposal there.

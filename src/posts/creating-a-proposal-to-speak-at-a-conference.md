This year is about me doing things out of my comfort zone. At the top of that list is public speaking. I've attended four Smashing Conferences now and have always wondered what it would be like to speak at one. Smashing Magazine, who puts on Smashing Conference, was one of the key factors in me wanting to become a Web Developer. They regularly have the most knowledgeable and friendly speakers present at their conferences each year. In order to be able to speak at that conference, I first need to build up my confidence, experience and delivery before attempting to submit a proposal there.

The first step in this journey to speak at a conference starts with the speaking proposal submission. This usually includes the title, description/abstract and bio.

**Step 1 - Pick a topic**

For the topic of my talk, I want to speak about something that has either benefitted myself during my career or a passion of mine that another person could incorporate into their work. Another option could be to speak about something that is new to me, which could benefit me and someone else for future work.

**Step 2 - Write the abstract**

The abstract of my talk will be my 30-second elevator pitch, where my audience is the selection committee and conference attendees. In this pitch, my goals is going to be to generate interest in my talk while clearly explaining what they will get from it. The abstract will usually answer the following questions:

* **What the talk is about?** Start with a sentence or two about the topic you are going to cover in your presentation.
  *Who is this talk for? Note what level of experience with certain technologies or languages attendees will need to benefit from hearing your talk. Is this an introductory talk that is applicable to anyone? Or is this talk for seasoned Spring Boot developers?
* **What will attendees take away?** Explain what attendees should expect to learn from your presentation. Setting clear expectations makes it easier for the speaker selection committee to understand what your talk should be included.
* **Why should they be excited to see this talk?** This can be a wide range of things. You might write about a specific experience, or discuss your new solution to a frequently experienced problem. Try to build excitement, credibility, or intrigue to draw interest into your presentation.

**Step 3 - Choose a title**

When the abstract is finished, the talk will need to be given a title. If title of the talk pops, that's great, but it's not the most important thing. The key to a great title is making sure the title clearly states what the topic is. In the blog post, "[How to Write a Headline that Makes People Click](https://copyblogger.com/how-to-write-headlines-that-work/)", they give a 3-step framework. 

* **S﻿tep 1: What does the content deliver?** The title should align with the information that the content actually delivers. It is encouraged to brainstorm titles before writing the content to make sure the maximum amount of people can relate to the content.
* S﻿tep 2: What is the Goal of Someone Consuming this Content? "The first step to writing compelling copy is understanding your audience avatar and then crafting your content to solve their pain points and help them achieve their goals. If your content isn’t helping them achieve their goals (assuming you’re creating educational content rather than entertainment content), then there isn’t really any incentive for them to consume it." Once the value that the content delivers has been defined, the next step is defining what the goal of a reader/attendee consuming the topic.\

  For example, the goal of someone searching "how to write a headline" is likely increasing clicks to their content.

  That’s why I decided to title this post "How to Write A Headline That Makes People Click."

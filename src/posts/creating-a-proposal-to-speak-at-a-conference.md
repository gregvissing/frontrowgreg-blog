T﻿his year is about me doing things out of my comfort zone. At the top of that list is public speaking. I've attended four Smashing Conferences now and have always wondered what it would be like to speak at one. Smashing Magazine, who puts on Smashing Conference, was one of the key factors in me wanting to become a Web Developer. They regularly have the most knowledgeable and friendly speakers present at their conferences each year. In order to be able to speak at that conference, I first need to build up my confidence, experience and delivery before attempting to submit a proposal there.

The first step in this journey to speak at a conference starts with the speaking proposal submission. This usually includes the title, description, abstract and bio.

F﻿or the topic of my talk, I want to speak about something that has either benefitted myself during my career or a passion of mine that another person could incorporate into their work. Another option could be to speak about something that is new to me, which could benefit me and someone else for future work.

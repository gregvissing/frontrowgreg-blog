Tï»¿his post will focus on the outline/basis for of how my conference talk will flow. With the title of the talk being  Design Systems: Bridging the Gap Between Designers and Developers, I need to first create the visual of a bridge and how each part of the bridge plays a part in the structure of it's stability and maintainability, so that people can get from point A (start of the bridge) to point B (end of the bridge).

This post feels good to finally write after the struggle I had deciding how I wanted the site to look and what topic(s) I wanted it to contain. Questions such as: which language to use?, which framework or boilerplate would be best for me? Should I make it topic specific? The list went on an on.

After seeing [Cassie Evans](https://www.cassie.codes/) Tweet that she was launching her new site I had to see what she was using and I'm so glad I did. Reading through her post about [website decisions](https://www.cassie.codes/posts/shoes-at-last/), I'm glad I wasn't the only one over-thinking this whole process. I deployed the [Hylia starter kit](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia) she mentioned and have been sold ever since! The Hylia starter kit is a blend of the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), which allows even non-developers to get started on their website journey! Many of the starter templates I tried using in Netlify's list of ready-to-go [templates](https://templates.netlify.com/) didn't have an option where you could save posts as drafts and come back later without some custom development. I was more interested in getting out content than I was with playing with the back-end code.

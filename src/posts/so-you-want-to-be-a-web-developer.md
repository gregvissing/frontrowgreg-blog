Web Development can be one of the most rewarding jobs out on the market today, but it also comes with challenges. To be a successful developer, you must continue to practice your craft, even outside of work. Whether it's taking online courses or creating made up projects, these exercises will help to make projects at work go smoother.

I've taken many different online courses from many different instructors. I usually look at the reviews and the course content to see what the best course to take is. The following are sites were I've taken online courses from: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/), [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/) and [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/). Udemy offers courses for $10 sometimes, but the other three you have to subscribe to. I have a lifetime subscription to SitePoint that I purchased through Mighty Deals in 2016. That deal was too good to pass up!

A successful developer must also be able to troubleshoot their code, because errors are going to come up whether you want them to or not. This is a skill all by itself. You have to know what you are looking for and then pick trustworthy sources. Stack Overflow is usually a good place to look for answers. There are many Slack channels out there for developers to find answers in as well. It's important to know why the error occurred when you fix it just in case it arises again down the road.

Looking through job postings can be a bit intimidating if you don't have an idea of the type of developer job you want. There are many different tech stacks to consider and companies vary in size, from small digital agencies to large corporations. It's always best to research the company you are applying at, because they will ask you on the phone and in person if you know what they do. "I don't know is never the right answer." The more interest you show in the company, the more interested they'll be in hiring you.

Even after landing a job, the learning should never stop. Learn what your responsibilities are, according to the job description, and even find ways to make those tasks go smoother. An organized employee is usually a successful employee. I write down my tasks/projects for the day in my planner.

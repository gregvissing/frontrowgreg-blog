T﻿hanks to my employer, I'll be attending my fifth Smashing Conference this October in New York. It is a benefit that I haven't taken for granted since working for them in December of 2017. When they told me about this benefit, I knew there was only one conference I wanted to attend. That was Smashing Conference! Looking back at my email account, I started subscribing to their newsletter in 2013. I was instantly hooked by the content they were posting on their website and newsletters. Two years later, I had completed my Bachelor's degree at Northern Kentucky University, to finish out my degree. From following Smashing, I knew that I wanted to become a Web Developer. I had tried to solve their challenges to win a ticket to come to a Smashing Conference because that was the only way I was going to possibly be able to attend one. 

I﻿ remember attending my first Smashing Conference in San Francisco in the Spring of 2018. I was so nervous as this was the first time I had traveled out west by myself and getting the opportunity to meet people I had looked up for for so long. During the talks, I was in such aww of the content that was being delivered by the speakers. It wasn't until the After Party event, on the first night of the conference talks, where I truly felt like I belonged there.

Tï»¿hanks to my employer, I'll be attending my fifth Smashing Conference this October in New York. It is a benefit that I haven't taken for granted since working for them in December of 2017. When they told me about this benefit, I knew there was only one conference I wanted to attend. That was Smashing Conference! Looking back at my email account, I started subscribing to their newsletter in 2013. I was instantly hooked by the content they were posting on their website and newsletter. Two years later, I had completed my Bachelor's degree at Northern Kentucky University, to finish out my degree.

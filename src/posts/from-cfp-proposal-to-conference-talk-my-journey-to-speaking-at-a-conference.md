E﻿ver since attending my first conference in 2018, I've always looked up to the speakers who were presenting, which in turn has really helped to elevate my work based on what I learned. Fast-forward today and I've attended four Smashing Conferences in some amazing cities (San Francisco, Toronto and Freiburg, Germany). Working in the non-profit over the last 7+ years has taught me valuable lessons which I want to share with others in the community. The areas in which I'll need the most polishing are in the following areas:

* P﻿racticing speaking in front of groups while making eye contact and speaking clearly
* Getting over imposter syndrome
* S﻿tructuring a conference talk with slides

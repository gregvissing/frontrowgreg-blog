This event was the first in-person conference I had attended since SmashingConf Toronto, in 2019. SmashingConf has been my go-to conference to attend since 2018, due to the organization/friendliness by the Smashing staff, relatable topics from speakers and the hands-on workshops. 

Iâ€™m blessed to have an employer which prioritizes my growth as a web developer. They allow me to attend one conference per fiscal year. When I was told a month into my employment to pick a conference to attend, there was only one conference I had to attend. SmashingConf!

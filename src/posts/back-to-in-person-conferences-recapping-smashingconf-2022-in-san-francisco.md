Back to In-Person Conferences! Recapping SmashingConf 2022 in San Francisco

This event was the first in-person conference I had attended since SmashingConf Toronto, in 2019. SmashingConf has been my go-to conference to attend since 2018, due to the organization/format/friendliness by the Smashing staff, relatable topics from speakers and the hands-on workshops.

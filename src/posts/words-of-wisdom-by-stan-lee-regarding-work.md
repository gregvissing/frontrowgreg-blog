It's been a little over two years since the passing of [Stan Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee), but the following quote of his always makes me reflect on what I've learned, to do the job that I love.

I think whatever you do you should **do what you most want to do** and **what you’re best at**. Too many people don’t do what their heart’s desire is. They try to do something else ’cause they think **it will be easy** to get a job or make money. And if that happens then when you’re doing it **you feel like you’re working**. But if you do what you really want to do you **feel like you’re playing** and it’s **easier for you to do**. **\- Stan Lee**

Above, I've highlighted some of the words from this quote that stick out to me.

Too often I see people either settling for their current job that they hate or getting in the field they want to be in, but not pushing themselves to be the best they can be and moving up the ladder. I used to be in that situation but learned my lesson once I realized I had to keep learning to make projects easier to plan and build. Since that job I've really built up a foundation of knowledge that makes each part of the project go smoother. I continue to try to refine each section of the following project workflow processes:

* Initial meeting
* Plan/Strategy
* Design/Wireframe
* Build
* Test
* Launch
* Maintain

When Mr. Lee mentioned someone just getting a job because they think it will be easy or just to make money, it made me wonder how many people out there are like that. I'm sure there could be variables such as money or time to learn a new skill/trade. When someone is unhappy with their job you can usually tell right away. Their attitude, either on the job or social media posts complaining about it, can often be a bad reflection on the company. There are times when I'll ask those I'm familiar with if they are interested in the IT/Web Development field, because I love helping others gain new knowledge that could be useful for a future job/project. I have a plethora of bookmarks that I've categorized to get someone resources on the spot. I'm actually currently helping a friend of mine break into the Development field. I talked to him on the phone and gave him the Pros/Cons of the job as well as my recommendations on type of Development job he might be most interested in based on what kind of work he wants to do.

I'm at the stage in my career where I feel like I'm playing and it's easier for me to do, as Stan Lee said in his quote. I love coming in every day to work, even on Mondays, to tackle all of the challenges that the day has to offer. Over time, I've gone from spinning my wheels on technical issues to knowing where to look or who to ask in the Developer community. One thing I'll mention when looking for a new job is to really research the culture of the company. Find out as much as you can either before or during the interview to get a sense of what it's like to work for the company because when you find a place where you can do what you love plus enjoy the people you work with, that's an amazing feeling. If you can find that and they'll invest in you to keep getting better, that company is a "keeper!" I've had the amazing privilege of attending Smashing Conference in San Francisco and Toronto the past two years, which has really helped to further my career from everything I've learned at them. I'm forever grateful for my employer putting the trust and investment into me to better myself, thus making the work I do for them at a high quality.

Thank you for reading this blog! I appreciate you taking the time to read my thought for the day. Have a great day.

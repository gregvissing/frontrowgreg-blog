Developing a Donation Form for the UC Foundation that converts donations requires careful research and planning from start to finish. Everyone involved in the project needs to know their role, which includes, their responsibilities, due dates and how their part impacts the success of the project.

I will break down this post into sections, similar to the [UK Government Design Principles and examples](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles).

1. Start with user needs\
   *
2. Do less\
   *
3. Design with data\
   *
4. Do the hard work to make it simple\
   *
5. Iterate. Then iterate again\
   *
6. This is for everyone\
   *
7. Understand context\
   *
8. Build digital services, not websites\
   *
9. Be consistent, not uniform\
   *
10. Make things open: it makes things better

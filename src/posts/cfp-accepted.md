Iï»¿t was May 2nd that I found out that my conference talk proposal was accepted! I remember submitting my proposal of Design Systems: Bridging the Gap Between Developers and Designers on February 19th unsure if my talk would be picked. Part of me, at the time, wondered if I was even qualified to speak on the topic of Design Systems. It's been around a year since we started the creation of our Design System at the University of Cincinnati Foundation. Through multiple meetings with the designers, we discussed, debated and tested our ideas of how we wanted the design system to turn out. Each of us set our ego aside to work toward a common goal.

Since finding out I was going to speak at the Digital Collegium conference, at the end of September, I've reached out to speakers whom I've met at the various Smashing Conferences I've attend for tips and advice. The following are some of the responses I've received.

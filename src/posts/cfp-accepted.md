Iï»¿t was May 2nd that I found out that my conference talk proposal was accepted! I remember submitting my proposal of Design Systems: Bridging the Gap Between Developers and Designers on February 19th unsure if my talk would be picked. Part of me, at the time, wondered if I was even qualified to speak on the topic of Design Systems. It's been around a year since we started the creation of our Design System at the University of Cincinnati Foundation.

Have you ever had that moment during a meeting where you get frustrated explaining terminology to co-workers? 

After a recent meeting with the designers on my team, I came away a little frustrated about the communication gap regarding how HTML elements are laid out on a page. Their work consists mostly of designing for print, so my frustration quickly pivoted to an idea based on creating an HTML/CSS workshop to mentor them, in hopes of getting them on the same page. 

I've always wanted to create my own course on a platform, such as Teachable, but never found the time to put one together.

### Background

My name is Greg Vissing and I'm from Cincinnati, OH. I'm currently a Web Developer & UI Designer at the University of Cincinnati Foundation. I specialize in custom Web Development.

### Job History

**Employer:** University of Cincinnati Foundation

**Title:** Web Developer & UI Designer

As a member of the digital communications team, I provide custom solutions to client needs across the Foundation. The Web Developer and UI Designer should speak both the business and technical languages fluently, and be passionate about hands-on technical configuration, creative problem solving and mentoring. While the primary focus of the position will be public-facing content on foundation.uc.edu and alumni.uc.edu, the Web Developer and UI Designer will need to develop a strong working understanding of how the fundraising database (Blackbaud CRM) integrates with the website in order to develop custom online parts.
